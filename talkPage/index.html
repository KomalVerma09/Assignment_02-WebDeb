Additionally without evidence (other than an archaic image where a leucistic peahen is included with a "Pavo nigripennis") this would be original research and a reliable source would be a paper on the genetic inheritance of the traits. Something like doi:10.1093/jhered/82.1.64 at the very least. Shyamal (talk) 02:06, 23 February 2011 (UTC)</p>

                            <p class="para4">This entry is generally very well written. The introduction is of a reasonable length and briefly summarizes some key points about Indian peafowl, such as their most prominent ornate train. In examining the particularly article sections, the taxonomy and naming section puts a lot of emphasis on the history of the naming, but ignores the taxonomy aspect. It would be more complete if there was information about Indian Peafowl’s position on the phylogenetic tree. The description section is very detailed. The distribution and habitat section may benefit from more description about peacocks’ nests, i.e. whether they have a nest, who builds it and what it is like. In the mortality factor section, common parasites and diseases of Indian peacocks might be added to the predation factor alone. This article has been constantly updated. As a result, its content is relatively rich and comprehensive. Tianyi Cai (talk) 12:46, 26 September 2012 (UTC)</p>
